    * Under new management!
    * Test::Harness is now being concurrently shipped on CPAN as well
      as in the core.
    - Switched "our" for "use vars" and moved the minimum version back
      to 5.004.  This may be optimistic.


*** Version history to be extracted from Perl changes ***


1.07  Fri Feb 23 1996 by Andreas Koenig
    - Gisle sent me a documentation patch that showed me, that the
      unless(/^#/) is unnessessary. Applied the patch and deleted the block
      checking for "comment" lines. -- All lines are comment lines that do
      not match /^1\.\.([0-9]+)/ or /^(not\s+)?ok\b/.
    - Ilyaz request to print "ok (empty test case)" whenever we say 1..0
      implemented.
    - Harness now doesn't abort anymore if we received confused test output,
      just warns instead.

1.02  by Andreas Koenig
    - This version reports a list of the tests that failed accompanied by
      some trivial statistics. The older (unnumbered) version stopped
      processing after the first failed test.
    - Additionally it reports the exit status if there is one.
