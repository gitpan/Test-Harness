=head1 v1.07 February 23 1996 by Andreas Koenig

Gisle sent me a documentation patch that showed me, that the
unless(/^#/) is unnessessary. Applied the patch and deleted the block
checking for "comment" lines. -- All lines are comment lines that do
not match /^1\.\.([0-9]+)/ or /^(not\s+)?ok\b/.

Ilyaz request to print "ok (empty test case)" whenever we say 1..0
implemented.

Harness now doesn't abort anymore if we received confused test output,
just warns instead.

More updates on docu and introduced the liberality that the script
output may omit the test numbers.

=head1 v1.03 January 28 1996 by Andreas Koenig

Added the statistics for subtests. Updated the documentation.

=head1 v1.02 by Andreas Koenig

This version reports a list of the tests that failed accompanied by
some trivial statistics. The older (unnumbered) version stopped
processing after the first failed test.

Additionally it reports the exit status if there is one.
