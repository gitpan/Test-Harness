The module Test::Harness implements a simple interface for running
standard perl tests. Those produce some output similar to

1..5
ok 1
ok 2
ok 3
ok 4
ok 5

The Test::Harness module runs such tests and watches the output and
summarizes the results.

To install run

    perl Makefile.PL
    make install

You may also run 'make test'. Be prepared that most of the tests will
fail. This is intentional.
